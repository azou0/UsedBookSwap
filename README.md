*** The Used Book Swapping Platform is a system that enables students and readers to exchange books. It allows users to register, list books, browse listings, and initiate swaps either from the browsing or directly from another userâ€™s profile. The project is being designed using SysML for requirements, structure, and constraints, and Agile project management practices with JIRA for planning. ***
